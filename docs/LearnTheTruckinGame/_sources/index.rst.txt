Welcome to Traveling Trailsmen's Documentation!

In this game you play as a trucker, trying to gain as much renown before the year is up! Renown is gained by completing contracts, with harder contracts giving 
more renown. Contracts also give money, which you'll need to keep going and to upgrade your truck. Contracts are completed by traveling from the start node to
the finish node within the contract's deadline. Failure to deliver before a contract's deadline will result in no renown or money reward. During the course of
moving between nodes events will occur, which will cause damage to your truck and waste your time. The game can end early if your truck becomes too damaged 
or runs out of gas. The penalties from events can be mitigated by upgrading your truck. The game will complete after 10,000 (in game) hours.
