So, I just wanna say that this visualizer was made in 2 weeks and is a horrible spaghetti monster... but it worked. If you want to use this code as a reference, I'd advise you not to. It's full of solutions that weren't clean but I knew how to do it. If you still want to reference it, I commented it a bit for ya. Check out the script by opening the project in godot and clicking on the "scroll" icon next to Node2D.
