# Postmortem:
- Similar level of issues to Market Space
    - Not the worst, but close. Lots of room for improvement.
- Issues
    - Wren left early, only one with strong idea of final game design
        - In future design should be discussed in depth at start of development
        - All devs should understand plan and goals for game
    - Scrimmage Server
        - Major problems, needs rework or rewrite
    - Lack of accountability
        - Need more active role/better mentoring
        - Hierarchy brought up
            - Could result in conflict of egos
        - Potential for scrum master/project manager role
            - Create project guidelines, scrum master responsible for ensuring process is followed
            - May not solve development issues
    - Development Timeline
        - Critical components of game need to be finished sooner
        - Development should continue over the summer
        - Ideally allow several months for testing and balancing
    - Pull Requests
        - Need to be stricter
        - Weekly PR
            - Review, identify issues
            - Game must run, no partial implementations merged
            - Unit tests put in place when introducing new feature
                - Test abnormal input
        - More people need to review
            - Tag at least two people to review
    - Visualizer 
        - Needs to be started earlier
